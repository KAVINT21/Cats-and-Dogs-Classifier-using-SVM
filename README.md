# Cats-and-Dogs-Classifier-using-SVM

# Dependencies

keras
numpy
pillow
gradio

# Overview
This project implements a Cats Image Classifier using a pre-trained Keras model. The model is capable of classifying cat images into different categories. Gradio is utilized to create an interactive user interface for users to upload images and receive predictions in real-time.

# Project Components

# 1. Model Loading and Initialization
The Keras model is loaded from the saved file (keras_Model.h5) using the load_model function. The labels for the classes are loaded from the labels.txt file.

# 2. Gradio Interface
Gradio is employed to create an interactive interface where users can upload cat images and receive predictions. The Interface is defined with the classify_image function as the prediction function.
